<h1>India's CPI Inflaction</h1>
This project focuses on analyzing India's Consumer Price Index (CPI) Inflation over the period 2017 to 2023 by examining rural, urban, and rural-urban combined sectors. It helps to evaluate inflation trends, identify sectoral differences, and understand how external shocks such as Covid-19 and global oil price fluctuations have impacted the Indian economy.
                    <br>The dataset used in this project was collected from multiple sources, including official government portals. This ensures a more comprehensive and reliable representation of inflation patterns across categories like Food, Health, Essentials, Apparel, Housing, Transport, and others.
                    <br>The project applies data cleaning, preprocessing, and segmentation techniques to organize the dataset into meaningful categories.
                    <br>The dataset includes Sector, Year, Month and several categories. 
                    <br><br>The goal of this project is to analyze India's CPI inflation trends (2017–2023) using data from multiple sources, compare rural and urban sector differences, study the impact of Covid-19 and oil prices, and provide insights through dashboards to help policymakers and businesses manage inflation effectively.
